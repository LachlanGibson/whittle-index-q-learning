# Modelling and Solving the Restless Multi-Armed Bandit Problem

This repository includes a python implementation for the algorithm described in "[A Novel Implementation of Q learning for the Whittle Index](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-92511-6_10)" by Lachlan J. Gibson, Peter Jacko and Yoni Nazarathy, [presented](https://youtu.be/XoKw-bsBH98) at EAI VALUETOOLS 2021.

A short demonstration on how to run the code is contained in the `example.py` file.
